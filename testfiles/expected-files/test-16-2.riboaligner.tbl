#
# Explanation of possible values in unexpected_features column:
#
# This column will include a '-' if none of the features listed below are detected.
# Or it will contain one or more of the following types of messages. There are no
# whitespaces in this field, to make parsing easier.
#
# Values that begin with "*" automatically cause a sequence to FAIL.
# Values that do not begin with "*" do not cause a sequence to FAIL.
#
#  1.  *NoHits                 No primary hits to any models above the minimum primary score
#                              threshold of 20 bits (--minpsc) were found.
#  2.  *UnacceptableModel      Best hit is to a model that is 'unacceptable' as defined in
#                              input file test-16-2/test-16-2.riboaligner.ribotyper.accept (--inaccept).
#  3.  *MultipleFamilies       One or more primary hits to two or more "families" (e.g. SSU
#                              or LSU) exists for the same sequence.
#  4.  *BothStrands            One or more primary hits above the minimum primary score threshold
#                              of 20 bits (--minpsc) were found on each strand.
#  5.  *DuplicateRegion        At least two hits (primary or secondary) on the same strand overlap
#                              in model coordinates by 20 (--maxoverlap) positions or more
#  6.  *InconsistentHits       Not all hits (primary or secondary) are in the same order in the
#                              sequence and in the model.
#  7.  *MinusStrand            Best hit is on the minus strand.
#  8.  *LowScore               The bits per nucleotide (total bit score divided by total length
#                              of sequence) is below threshold of 0.5 (--lowppossc).
#  9.  *LowCoverage            The total coverage of all hits (primary and secondary) to the best
#                              model (summed length of all hits divided by total length of sequence)
#                              is below threshold of 0.86 (--tcov).
# 10.  QuestionableModel       Best hit is to a model that is 'questionable' as defined in
#                              input file test-16-2/test-16-2.riboaligner.ribotyper.accept (--inaccept).
# 11.  LowScoreDifference      The difference between the top two domains is below the 'low'
#                              threshold of 0.10 (--lowpdiff) bits per position (total bit score
#                              divided by summed length of all hits).
# 12.  VeryLowScoreDifference  The difference between the top two domains is below the 'very low'
#                              threshold of 0.04 (--vlowpdiff) bits per position (total bit score
#                              divided by summed length of all hits).
# 13.  MultipleHits            There is more than one hit to the best scoring model on the same strand.
